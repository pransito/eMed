eMed analyses for inventory data, psychosocial data etc.

inventory
---------

inventory folder is building upon the inventory excel file fomr the ngfn data; it will make a summary of all subjects and what
data there are available for this subjects

we then go beyond that and add information from spss files, such as gender, age, relapse, etc. and other psychosocial data


psychosocial data is tricky because we are wroking from several spss files and need to combine patchy information with bad ID
allocation or even multiple ID variables

this part of the repository (inventory and psychosocial) is to keep track of how we read in all the inventory and psychosocial and
evene genetic data of the 499 subjects
